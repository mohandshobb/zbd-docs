## Overview

The ZBD Rewards Events SDK enables you to credit rewards to your users at your discretion (any amount at any time). However, users can only *withdraw* earned rewards up to a specified threshold based on their gameplay time.

For instance, when a user first downloads the game, you may credit the user 100 sats, but they may be limited to withdraw only up to 50 sats for a few minutes.

The player’s withdrawal limit increases the longer they engage with the game. For example, after 20 minutes of gameplay, they may be able to withdraw up to 100 sats. This system enhances the SDK's security while still providing most users with a quick and easy way to earn and withdraw Bitcoin.

In the following sections, we’ll explore how to send rewards and check a user’s withdrawal limit.
