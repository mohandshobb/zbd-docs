### Dependencies

The ZBDSDK in Android requires a few dependenices to be installed. To make this as smooth as possible we included the `External Dependency Manager` in the package. This should automatically install the dependencies and deal with any duplicate classes.

However, you may need to manually resolve the dependencies by going to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assets">
  </Step>
  <Step title="External Dependency Manager">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Android Resolver">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve">
  </Step>
</Steps>

If during the build process you get build errors, specifically mentioning duplicate classes you may need to go to 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assets">
  </Step>
  <Step title="External Dependency Manager">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Android Resolver">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete Resolved Libraries">
  </Step>
</Steps>
